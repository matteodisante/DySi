What is rocket-sim?
-------------------

**rocket-sim** is a production-ready simulation framework built on `RocketPy <https://github.com/RocketPy-Team/RocketPy>`_,
designed for:

* **Student rocketry teams** designing competition vehicles
* **Aerospace engineering students** learning trajectory simulation
* **Research groups** analyzing rocket performance
* **High-power rocketry enthusiasts** planning ambitious flights

Key Features
------------

✅ **YAML-based configuration** - No Python coding required for basic simulations

✅ **Comprehensive validation** - Automatic checks for physical plausibility and stability

✅ **Publication-quality outputs** - Professional plots and multiple export formats

✅ **Weather integration** - Real atmospheric data from multiple sources

✅ **Advanced control** - Air brakes with PID, bang-bang, or MPC controllers
